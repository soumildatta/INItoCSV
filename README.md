This is a simple utility script that converts a folder of .ini files with identical keys to a csv file. The keys of the .ini files becomes the header of the csv file, and the values of each file becomes a row.

## Usage
To run this script, open a terminal and type:   
```python INItoCSV.py <inputFolderName> <outputFileName>```   
Replace **<inputFolderName>** with the name of the folder consisting the .ini files. Replace <outputFileName> with the output csv file name including the .csv extention.
